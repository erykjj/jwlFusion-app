# Privacy Policy for *jwlFusion*

Last Updated: 2025-08-20

1. Introduction

*jwlFusion* ("the app") respects your privacy. This *Privacy Policy* explains that **no personal information is requested or collected by *jwlFusion***, other than the files the user selects to merge. The app does not collect, store, or transmit any data beyond the necessary functions for file manipulation.

2. Information We Collect

*jwlFusion* does not collect any personal information from users. The app only interacts with the *.jwlibrary* archive files selected by the user for the purpose of merging them. No other data is requested, stored, or transmitted.

3. File Access

*jwlFusion* requires permission to access local storage in order to open and merge *.jwlibrary* archives. All files handled within the app are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded or shared without your explicit action (e.g., using Android's share intent).

4. Backup Archives

Any original *.jwlibrary* backup archives opened in *jwlFusion* will remain unaltered. *jwlFusion* does not modify the original backup archives in any way. New merged backups are created in separate locations, preserving the integrity of the original files.

5. Data Security

*jwlFusion* takes reasonable precautions to protect the information and files you choose to open and manipulate within the app. However, it cannot guarantee 100% security due to the nature of digital transmission and storage.

6. Third-Party Services

*jwlFusion* does not integrate with any third-party services that collect personal data. However, it may utilize Androidâ€™s built-in file picker (Storage Access Framework) for accessing files on your device or cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive) when you choose to interact with them.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

*jwlFusion* may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users will be notified of significant changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Users are encouraged to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how data is protected.
