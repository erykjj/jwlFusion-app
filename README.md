This is an **Android 10+ app** to merge backups created by the *JW Library* app[^1] created on different devices.

By using this software you agree to abide by the terms of its [License](https://github.com/erykjj/jwlFusion#License-1-ov-file).

## Downloads

**Coming soon**

## Usage

Pick the two backup archives you wish to merge. The **Primary** one will take precedence in case of any conflicts; it will add to the **Secondary** one and over-write any duplicate records. The merge itself can take a few seconds, depending on the size of the archives. The merged backup will be "saved" (via *Share to…*) with a *jwlFusion_* prefix. You can send it to your cloud storage app (like Google Drive) to synchronize to your other device(s) where you can import it to *JW Library* (**Restore Backup**).
